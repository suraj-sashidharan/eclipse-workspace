"Dynamic Web Project" created with Eclipse.
Maven not used.
Eclipse allows WAR file creation with right click on project name and Export, WAR.
JARs that the app depends on can be added to WebContent/WEB-INF/lib and they become available in the compile classpath and also in WEB-INF/lib within the WAR. For eg., jstl-1.2.jar
